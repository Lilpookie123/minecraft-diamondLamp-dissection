        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Roland Robinson, and this project is a reflection of my passion for both electronics and Minecraft. Growing up, Minecraft was more than just a game to me—it was a creative outlet that sparked my curiosity about how things worked. I was fascinated by redstone, the game’s virtual circuitry system, and how it could be used to create complex mechanisms. That fascination with redstone taught me the basics of circuits and logic, which ultimately inspired me to study Computer Engineering at Mississippi State University.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this dissection project, I chose the Minecraft Diamond Ore Light because it perfectly combines my love for engineering and the game that shaped my early interest in technology. Dissecting this product allows me to explore the real-world circuits and design that bring a piece of Minecraft to life. It’s a project that connects my childhood curiosity with my career aspirations, and I hope it inspires others to see the magic behind the technology they use every day.
